                                                        url_for() function
In Flask, url_for() is a function that generates URLs based on the name of the function and the arguments provided. It is commonly used in templates and view functions for creating links to other pages within the application.

When creating dynamic URLs in Flask, url_for() is particularly useful because it allows you to specify the name of the view function and any dynamic parameters required for that function in a single call. This makes it easy to create links to other pages that depend on dynamic values without hard-coding the URLs, which can be error-prone and inflexible.

For example, url_for() is used to redirect the user to either the high() or low() view functions based on the value of the result variable. This allows the application to dynamically generate the appropriate URL based on the user's input, rather than hard-coding two separate URLs and switching between them based on a conditional statement.

Overall, url_for() is a powerful tool for creating dynamic URLs in Flask applications, and is a recommended approach for building flexible and maintainable web applications.

                                                        redirect() fucntion
In Flask, the redirect() function is used to redirect the user to a different URL, typically in response to some user action or input.

When creating dynamic URLs in Flask, the redirect() function is often used in conjunction with the url_for() function. Here's how it works:

1. A user performs some action or provides input that requires a redirection to a different URL.
2. The Flask application captures the user's input and uses it to determine the appropriate URL to redirect to, typically by calling a view function with dynamic parameters.
3. The url_for() function is used to generate the URL for the view function, based on the dynamic parameters.
4. The redirect() function is called with the generated URL as its argument, instructing the browser to navigate to the new URL.

For example, the redirect() function is used in the results() view function to redirect the user to either the high() or low() view function, depending on the value of the result variable. The url_for() function is used to generate the appropriate URL for the chosen view function, based on the dynamic parameter (number) passed to the results() function.

Overall, the redirect() function is an essential tool for creating dynamic URLs in Flask applications, allowing you to dynamically redirect users to different pages based on their input or other criteria.
