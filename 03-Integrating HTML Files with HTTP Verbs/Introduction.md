                                                              HTTP Verbs
Flask is a web development framework for Python that allows developers to easily create web applications. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It is a request-response protocol used to transfer data between clients and servers. HTTP defines several request methods or verbs that are used by clients to send data to the server.

In Flask, there are two primary HTTP methods that are used in web development: GET and POST.

GET method: This method is used to retrieve data from the server. When a client sends a GET request, it expects a response that contains the requested data. GET requests can be sent through URLs or query parameters. In Flask, the @app.route decorator is used to define a route for a GET request. When a user visits the specified URL, Flask will call the associated function and return the response.

POST method: This method is used to submit data to the server. When a client sends a POST request, it sends data in the request body instead of the URL or query parameters. This method is typically used for forms and other data submission operations. In Flask, the @app.route decorator can also be used to define a route for a POST request. When a user submits a form, Flask will call the associated function and pass the form data in the request.

Other HTTP methods include PUT, DELETE, PATCH, and OPTIONS. These methods are used less frequently but are also available in Flask.

It is important to note that Flask allows you to define routes that can handle multiple HTTP methods. This is achieved by specifying the allowed methods in the @app.route decorator. For example, if you want to define a route that can handle both GET and POST requests, you can use the following syntax: 

    @app.route('/example', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
    def example():
        if request.method == 'GET':
            # handle GET request
        elif request.method == 'POST':
            # handle POST request
            
This allows you to handle different types of requests in the same function, which can be useful in certain situations.
