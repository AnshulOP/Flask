Flask is a popular web framework in Python used to build web applications. Integrating CSS and JavaScript into Flask applications is essential for creating interactive, dynamic, and visually appealing web applications. Here's how to integrate CSS and JavaScript in Flask:

1. Static Folder: Flask provides a "static" folder for storing static files like CSS and JavaScript. Create a folder called "static" at the root of your Flask project.
2. CSS: Inside the static folder, create another folder called "css". Add your CSS files to this folder.
3. JavaScript: Inside the static folder, create another folder called "js". Add your JavaScript files to this folder.
4. Linking CSS: To link your CSS files to your HTML templates.
5. Linking JavaScript: To link your JavaScript files to your HTML templates.
6. Serving Static Files: Flask needs to know where to find the static folder. To do this, add the following code to your Flask application:

        from flask import Flask
        app = Flask(__name__)
        app.static_folder = 'static'
        
7. Testing: Start your Flask application and test that your CSS and JavaScript files are properly linked to your HTML templates. You should see the styles and scripts applied to your web page.
