Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a micro-framework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies, and several common framework-related tools.

Flask was created by Armin Ronacher of Pocoo in 2010. The framework was originally designed as an April Fool's joke, but it gained enough popularity that development continued.

Flask is known for its simplicity and flexibility. It provides a minimalistic set of tools that allow developers to build web applications quickly and easily. Flask is also known for its extensive documentation and vibrant community, which provide users with a wealth of resources for learning and troubleshooting.

Some of the key features of Flask include :

1. Lightweight and Flexible: Flask is lightweight and easy to use, making it ideal for small to medium-sized applications. It also provides a lot of flexibility, allowing developers to customize and extend the framework to meet their needs.
2. Easy to Learn: Flask's simplicity makes it easy to learn for developers who are new to web development.
3. Routing: Flask provides a built-in routing system that allows developers to map URLs to functions.
4. Templating: Flask comes with Jinja2, a powerful templating engine that allows developers to create dynamic HTML pages.
5. Flask Extensions: Flask supports a wide range of extensions that add functionality to the framework, including database integration, authentication, and debugging tools.

6. Testing: Flask provides a testing framework that makes it easy for developers to write and run tests for their applications.

7. Debugging: Flask provides a built-in debugger that allows developers to debug their applications easily.

Flask can be used for building web applications that incorporate machine learning models. Flask provides a convenient way to expose machine learning models as web services, allowing them to be used by other applications or consumed by end-users.

One way to use Flask with machine learning is to build an API that allows users to submit data to a machine learning model and receive predictions in response. Here's an example of how this can be done :-

1. Build a machine learning model using a library such as Scikit-learn or TensorFlow.
2. Create a Flask application that exposes an API endpoint for the machine learning model.
3. Use the Flask request object to retrieve data from the API endpoint.
4. Pass the data to the machine learning model and retrieve the predicted result.
5. Use the Flask jsonify function to return the predicted result to the user.
